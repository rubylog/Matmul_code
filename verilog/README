The corresponding Matmul_top_FPGA and the input memory module have the same version numbers.
Memory versions that do not have the corresponding version of the FPGA module are only for memory logic and synthesizability testing. 
The file used to generate the final FPGA bitstream was Matmul_top_FPGA_v4 (Input memory partition, factor 2), and the input memory used an external IP. 
The test bench used Matmul_top_FPGA_v1, and input_memory_v1. (No input memory partition)
You can ignore the rest of the versions.
